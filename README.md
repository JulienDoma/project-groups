Model is ran through the group_displayer.py file. The file is ran through the command line with the following command:
```
python group_displayer.py
```
selections_pitch.csv should be a file in the same directory as group_displayer.py. The file should contain a first column with the name of the students, and 1 column per project. The pitched column should contain the index of the project that the student pitched, i.e. if Joao pitched the project in the first column, joao's pitched column should contain a 0. If the student did not pitch a project, this field should be left empty (see example in the repository).
